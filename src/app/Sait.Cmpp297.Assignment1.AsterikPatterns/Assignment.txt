Write an application that displays the folowing patterns separately, one below the other.
Use for loops to generate the patterns. 
All asterisks (*) should be printed by a single statement of the form :
	- Console.Write("*");
	- which causes the asterisks to print side by side.
- A statement of the form:
	- Console.WriteLine();
	- can be used to move to the next line.
- A statement of the form :
	- Console.Write( ' ' );
	- can be used to display a space for the last two patterns.
- There should be no other output statements in the application.
[ hint: the last two patterns require that each line begin with an appropriate number of blank spaces. ]
